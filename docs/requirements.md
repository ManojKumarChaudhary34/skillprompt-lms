## Introduction

The Learning Management System (LMS) is a platform designed to teach coding skills to students through interactive courses, assessments, and projects. The platform aims to provide instructors with tools to create and manage courses while offering students a personalized, engaging learning experience.

---

## Functional Requirements

### 1. User Management

- **Student Registration/Login:**

  - Sign-up using email, social media (Google, Facebook), or SSO.
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for security.
  - Password recovery through email or SMS.

- **Instructor Registration/Login:**

  - Instructor onboarding with credentials verification.
  - Role-based access control for instructors (e.g., course creation permissions).

- **Admin Dashboard:**
  - Manage user accounts (add, edit, suspend, delete).
  - Assign and manage roles (student, instructor, admin).
  - View platform metrics such as total users, active courses, etc.

---

### 2. Course Management

- **Course Creation:**

  - Allow instructors to create courses with:
    - Title, description, prerequisites, and tags.
    - Upload materials such as PDFs, videos, and presentations.
    - Add coding assignments and interactive lessons.

- **Module and Lesson Organization:**

  - Support hierarchical organization (course → modules → lessons).
  - Enable drag-and-drop reordering of modules/lessons.

- **Versioning:**
  - Allow updating course content without disrupting existing learners.
  - Maintain a changelog for course updates.

---

### 3. Coding Exercises and Assessments

- **Interactive Coding Environment:**

  - Browser-based code editor with features:
    - Syntax highlighting and auto-completion.
    - Support for multiple languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.).
    - Real-time error detection and debugging tools.

- **Code Execution:**

  - Secure execution of code submissions via containerized environments (e.g., Docker).
  - Provide output/feedback instantly to students.

- **Challenges and Projects:**
  - Individual coding challenges with real-world use cases.
  - Group projects with collaborative tools (e.g., shared editor, GitHub integration).

---

### 4. Student Learning Features

- **Progress Tracking:**

  - Display progress percentage for each course and module.
  - Show milestone badges or certificates upon completion.

- **Discussion Forums:**

  - Enable students to ask questions and interact in course-specific threads.
  - Allow upvoting/downvoting of posts for community-driven answers.

- **Leaderboard:**

  - Gamify learning with points, badges, and rankings based on:
    - Quiz scores.
    - Assignment completion.
    - Overall participation.

- **Save Progress:**
  - Bookmark courses and save partially completed exercises.

---

### 5. Assessment and Feedback

- **Quiz Creation:**

  - Support for multiple-choice, short answer, and coding quizzes.
  - Time-limited quizzes with instant or manual grading options.

- **Feedback Mechanism:**

  - Allow students to leave ratings and reviews for courses.
  - Provide instructors with tools for detailed assignment feedback.

- **Grading System:**
  - Automatic grading for quizzes and coding challenges.
  - Manual grading interface for instructors to review code quality.

---

### 6. Communication Tools

- **Live Classes:**

  - Host live sessions with:
    - Screen sharing.
    - Real-time chat/Q&A.
    - Session recording for on-demand access.

- **Messaging System:**
  - Enable direct messaging between students and instructors.
  - Notification system for deadlines, announcements, and messages.

---

### 7. Analytics and Reporting

- **For Students:**

  - Personalized analytics showing:
    - Time spent on learning.
    - Areas of improvement based on quiz performance.

- **For Instructors:**

  - Reports on student performance and engagement.
  - Insights to improve course material and delivery.

- **For Admins:**
  - Metrics on platform usage, user retention, and course popularity.

---

### 8. Payment and Monetization

- **Payment Integration:**
